ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Pavan! <br>
Iâ€™m a passionate AI/ML enthusiast and full-stack web developer, always exploring how technology can solve real-world problems.

Currently diving deep into Python, Machine Learning, and AI-driven development, I also specialize in building fast, modern, and user-friendly websites using Next.js and other cutting-edge tools.

As a freelancer, I love collaborating with small businesses and startups â€” helping them build their digital presence through custom-coded solutions tailored to their needs.

ðŸ”§ Always learning. Always building. Always improving.
